Medical imaging: Use case sample Assignment 2
In our previous class, we discussed about fundamentals of medical image classification and sematic segmentation using deep neural networks followed by coding example for classification. You should consider multi-class classification. Based on the discussion, please complete the following tasks:

Develop three classification algorithms using Inception V3, Resnet, and squeezeNet on the following databases:

a. ABIDE Database – Autism classification (40 Marks)

b. HEP2 Cell classification. – (40 Marks)

Use this paper for dataset details:

Qi X, Zhao G, Chen J, Pietikäinen M. Exploring illumination robust descriptors for human epithelial type 2 cell classification. Pattern Recognition. 2016 Dec 1;60:420-9.

Develop an innovative architecture using the principles of Resnet and inception for

improved classification. (20 Marks)

Report to be submitted should include:

You have to submit the report with the code.

The report should contain a detailed study on the comparison of the three algorithms and their performances.

You have to explain the innovative architecture with the details and the choice of such an approach.

Rules:

Please submit individual assignment

Please follow the IITH ethics to write assignments

Plagiarism – strictly not entertained

Use the template to prepare and submit the answer of the assignment.

Test the performance of the network trained with the optimal set of parameters on the k-fold cross validation and report the confusion matrix, classification rate and F1 measure per class.

Think of a reasonable strategy to optimise parameters . Put more effort on optimising parameters you think are more important.

Make sure that your code runs. If not you will be asked to resubmit the code and lose 20% of the code mark.
